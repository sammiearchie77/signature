## Introduction

The `AuthController` is a part of your application's authentication system. It handles incoming HTTP requests related to user authentication, interacts with the `AuthService` for the business logic, and sends appropriate responses back to the client.

## Methods

### Signup

```javascript
async signup(req, res)
```

This method is used for user registration. It expects a JSON object containing user registration data in the request body. After successful registration, it returns a success response with the newly created user's information.

### Signin

```javascript
async signin(req, res)
```

This method is used for user login. It expects a JSON object with user login credentials (e.g., email and password) in the request body. Upon successful login, it returns a success response with user information.

### Update Password

```javascript
async updatePassword(req, res)
```

This method allows a user to update their password. It expects the user's ID as a parameter and a JSON object containing the new password in the request body. After successfully updating the password, it returns a success response.

### Request Email Verification

```javascript
async RequestEmailVerification(req, res)
```

This method is used to request email verification for a user. It expects the user's email as a parameter and sends an email verification link. It returns a success response upon successfully sending the verification email.

### Verify Email

```javascript
async VerifyEmail(req, res)
```

This method is called when a user clicks on the email verification link sent to their email. It expects a JSON object containing the verification token. Upon successful verification, it returns a success response.

### Request Password Reset

```javascript
async RequestPasswordReset(req, res)
```

This method is used to request a password reset link. It expects the user's email as a query parameter and sends a password reset link via email. It returns a success response upon successfully sending the reset link.

### Reset Password

```javascript
async resetPassword(req, res)
```

This method allows a user to reset their password after clicking the password reset link in their email. It expects a JSON object containing the new password. After successfully resetting the password, it returns a success response.

## Usage

To use the `AuthController`, you should import it into your routes or other parts of your application as needed. Make sure to set up the `AuthService` and `response` dependencies correctly.

```javascript
const AuthController = require('../controller/auth.controller.js');

// Use AuthController methods in your routes or controllers as needed.
```

## Dependencies

This controller assumes the existence of the following dependencies:

- `AuthService`: A service that handles the business logic for authentication operations.
- `response`: A utility module for generating consistent HTTP responses.

Ensure that these dependencies are correctly implemented and available in your project.
