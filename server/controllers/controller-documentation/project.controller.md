# project Controller

This is the controller file for managing Tasks in your Node.js application. It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Tasks. These methods interact with the `ProjectService` for business logic and send appropriate responses to clients.

## Introduction

The `ProjectController` is an essential part of your application's project management system. It handles incoming HTTP requests related to Tasks, delegates the business logic to the `ProjectService`, and sends appropriate responses back to the client.

## Methods

### Create

```javascript
async create(req, res)
```

This method is used to create a new project. It expects a JSON object containing project data in the request body. After successfully creating the Task, it returns a success response with the newly created Task's information.

### Get All

```javascript
async getAll(req, res)
```

This method retrieves a list of all Tasks. It does not require any parameters. It returns a success response with an array of all Tasks.

### Get One

```javascript
async getOne(req, res)
```

This method retrieves information about a specific project. It expects the `projectId` as a parameter. After successfully fetching the project data, it returns a success response with the Task's information.

### Update

```javascript
async update(req, res)
```

This method is used to update an existing project. It expects the `projectId` as a parameter and a JSON object containing the updated project data in the request body. After successfully updating the Task, it returns a success response with the updated Task's information.

### Delete

```javascript
async delete(req, res)
```

This method is used to delete a project. It expects the `projectId` as a parameter. After successfully deleting the Task, it returns a no-content response (HTTP status 204).

## Usage

To use the `ProjectController`, import it into your routes or other parts of your application where Task-related operations are needed. Make sure to set up the `ProjectService` and `response` dependencies correctly.

```javascript
const ProjectController = require('../controllers/project.controller');

// Use ProjectController methods in your routes or controllers as needed.
```

## Dependencies

This controller assumes the existence of the following dependencies:

- `ProjectService`: A service that handles the business logic for Project-related operations.
- `response`: A utility module for generating consistent HTTP responses.

Ensure that these dependencies are correctly implemented and available in your project.
