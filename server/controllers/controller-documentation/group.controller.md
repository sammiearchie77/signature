# Group Controller

This is the controller file for managing groups in your Node.js application. It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on groups. These methods interact with the `GroupService` for business logic and send appropriate responses to clients.

## Introduction

The `GroupController` is an essential part of your application's group management system. It handles incoming HTTP requests related to groups, delegates the business logic to the `GroupService`, and sends appropriate responses back to the client.

## Methods

### Create

```javascript
async create(req, res)
```

This method is used to create a new group. It expects a JSON object containing group data in the request body. After successfully creating the group, it returns a success response with the newly created group's information.

### Get All

```javascript
async getAll(req, res)
```

This method retrieves a list of all groups. It does not require any parameters. It returns a success response with an array of all groups.

### Get One

```javascript
async getOne(req, res)
```

This method retrieves information about a specific group. It expects the `groupId` as a parameter. After successfully fetching the group data, it returns a success response with the group's information.

### Update

```javascript
async update(req, res)
```

This method is used to update an existing group. It expects the `groupId` as a parameter and a JSON object containing the updated group data in the request body. After successfully updating the group, it returns a success response with the updated group's information.

### Delete

```javascript
async delete(req, res)
```

This method is used to delete a group. It expects the `groupId` as a parameter. After successfully deleting the group, it returns a no-content response (HTTP status 204).

## Usage

To use the `GroupController`, import it into your routes or other parts of your application where group-related operations are needed. Make sure to set up the `GroupService` and `response` dependencies correctly.

```javascript
const GroupController = require('../controllers/group.controller');

// Use GroupController methods in your routes or controllers as needed.
```

## Dependencies

This controller assumes the existence of the following dependencies:

- `GroupService`: A service that handles the business logic for Group-related operations.
- `response`: A utility module for generating consistent HTTP responses.

Ensure that these dependencies are correctly implemented and available in your project.
