# Main Router

The `index.router.js` file defines the index router for your Node.js application. This router serves as a central entry point for routing requests to various parts of your application, including authentication, user management, task management, project management, and group management.

## Routes

The index router uses the `express.Router()` to define routes for different parts of your application:

1. **Authentication Routes (`/auth`)**: These routes likely handle user authentication and include registration, login, email verification, and password reset. They are defined in the `auth.route.js` file.

2. **User Routes (`/users`)**: These routes handle user management, including listing, creating, updating, and deleting users. They are defined in the `user.route.js` file.

3. **Task Routes (`/tasks`)**: These routes manage tasks and include operations for listing, creating, updating, and deleting tasks. They are defined in the `task.route.js` file.

4. **Project Routes (`/projects`)**: These routes are responsible for project management and provide endpoints for listing, creating, updating, and deleting projects. They are defined in the `project.route.js` file.

5. **Group Routes (`/groups`)**: These routes handle group management, including listing, creating, updating, and deleting groups. They are defined in the `group.route.js` file.

## Usage

To use the index router in your application, import the `index.router.js` file and mount it on your Express.js app.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const indexRouter = require('../routes/index.router');

const app = express();

// Mount the index router
app.use('/api', indexRouter); // Use a prefix like '/api' for the index router

// ... other routes and middleware ...

// Start your Express app
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

This router serves as the entry point for all the routes defined in your application, organizing them into different categories for better code organization.

Ensure that you have correctly set up and imported the individual route files for authentication, user management, task management, project management, and group management.
