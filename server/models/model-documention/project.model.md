# Project Model

The `project.model.js` file defines the schema for the Project model in your Node.js application. This model represents projects and includes fields such as the project title, description, start date, end date, and team members.

## Schema

The Project schema defines the structure of a project document in your MongoDB database:

- `title`: A string representing the title of the project. It is required.
- `description`: A string representing the description of the project.
- `startDate`: A date representing the start date of the project.
- `endDate`: A date representing the end date of the project.
- `teamMembers`: An array of references to User documents representing the team members associated with the project.
- `timestamps`: Automatic timestamp fields for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

## Dependencies

This model file relies on the following dependencies:

- `mongoose`: A popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

Ensure that the `mongoose` dependency is correctly set up and available in your project.

## Usage

To use this Project model in your application, import it where needed and create, update, or query project data according to your application's logic.

```javascript
const Project = require('./path-to-project-model');

// Example: Creating a new project
const newProject = new Project({
  title: 'Project Title',
  description: 'Project description...',
  startDate: new Date('2023-01-01'), // Set the start date
  endDate: new Date('2023-12-31'), // Set the end date
  teamMembers: [userId1, userId2], // Add team members to the project
  // Other fields...
});

// Save the new project to the database
newProject.save()
  .then(savedProject => {
    console.log('Project saved:', savedProject);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error saving project:', error);
  });
```

You can also use the model's methods for CRUD operations as needed in your application.

```javascript
// Example: Querying projects
Project.find({ title: 'Project Title' })
  .populate('teamMembers') // Populate the teamMembers field with user data
  .then(projects => {
    console.log('Projects:', projects);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error querying projects:', error);
  });
```

Ensure that you customize and handle project data according to your application's requirements.
