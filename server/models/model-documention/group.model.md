# Group Model

The `group.model.js` file defines the schema for the Group model in your Node.js application. This model represents groups and includes fields such as the group name, description, members, and associated projects.

## Schema

The Group schema defines the structure of a group document in your MongoDB database:

- `name`: A string representing the name of the group. It is required and unique to ensure that group names are unique.
- `description`: A string representing the description of the group.
- `members`: An array of references to User documents representing the members of the group.
- `projects`: An array of references to Project documents representing the projects associated with the group.
- `timestamps`: Automatic timestamp fields for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

## Dependencies

This model file relies on the following dependencies:

- `mongoose`: A popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

Ensure that the `mongoose` dependency is correctly set up and available in your project.

## Usage

To use this Group model in your application, import it where needed and create, update, or query group data according to your application's logic.

```javascript
const Group = require('../model/group.model');

// Example: Creating a new group
const newGroup = new Group({
  name: 'Group Name',
  description: 'Group description...',
  members: [userId1, userId2], // Add members to the group
  projects: [projectId1, projectId2], // Associate projects with the group
  // Other fields...
});

// Save the new group to the database
newGroup.save()
  .then(savedGroup => {
    console.log('Group saved:', savedGroup);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error saving group:', error);
  });
```

You can also use the model's methods for CRUD operations as needed in your application.

```javascript
// Example: Querying groups
Group.find({ name: 'Group Name' })
  .populate('members') // Populate the members field with user data
  .populate('projects') // Populate the projects field with project data
  .then(groups => {
    console.log('Groups:', groups);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error querying groups:', error);
  });
```

Ensure that you customize and handle group data according to your application's requirements.
